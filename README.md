Requirements: 
  1.AutoHotkey from the Microsoft store
  2.Python 3
  3.PySimpleGUI
  
 Description:
  This program allows you to create a hotkey (.ahk) file that you can modify on the fly for one key at a time.  Each time you modify the key you need to re-launch the file.
  
 Goals:
  Eventually, I plan on creating an interactive checklist that maps a record of the items checked to a hotkey that can then be triggered in the appropriate space.
